# Collision Detection and Awareness System
An intelligent system for rear vehicle detection, tracking, and speed estimation using YOLOv8, DeepSORT, and homography. It provides visual lane zone classification (green/yellow/red) and real-time audio-visual alerts to help prevent collisions. The GUI is built with Tkinter.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects vehicles (car, truck, motorcycle, bus) using YOLOv8
- Tracks vehicle movement using DeepSORT
- Estimates real-world speed using homography and bounding box tracking
### 🎯 Key Concepts

#### 🚘 Relative Speed Estimation
- The system assumes the **host vehicle is stationary**.
- Each detected vehicle's position (bottom-center of bounding box) is transformed from pixel coordinates to **real-world meters** using **homography mapping**.
- Using the movement of these real-world points across video frames, the **relative speed** of each vehicle is estimated in **km/h**.

#### 🟫 Virtual Lane Zones (Trapezoid Area)
- A **trapezoidal virtual lane** is overlaid on the frame and divided into:
  - 🟢 **Green Zone** (Safe)
  - 🟡 **Yellow Zone** (Caution)
  - 🔴 **Red Zone** (Danger)
- If a vehicle's **bounding box overlaps any zone by more than 5%**, it is considered present in that zone.

#### 🎨 Bounding Box Color Logic
Bounding boxes are drawn based on the vehicle's **zone and speed**:
- 🟢 **Green Zone**:
  - Speed ≤ 10 km/h → Green box( just to show over speeding case if vechile in green zone is overspeeding)
  - Speed > 10 km/h → Yellow box
- 🟡 **Yellow Zone**:
  - Speed ≤ 8 km/h → Yellow box
  - Speed > 8 km/h → Red box
- 🔴 **Red Zone**:
  - Speed ≤ 5 km/h → Yellow box
  - Speed > 5 km/h → Red box

### 🚦 Traffic Light Indicator (Tkinter UI)
- The system shows a **traffic light-style indicator** based on the most dangerous detection in the current frame:
  - 🔴 Red → Critical danger detected
  - 🟡 Yellow → Warning
  - 🟢 Green → Safe

---

### 🔊 Audio Alerts
- The system plays looping **audio alerts** depending on the most severe zone:
  - 🔴 **Red Zone** → High alert sound
  - 🟡 **Yellow Zone** → Warning alert sound
  - 🟢 **Green Zone** → No sound
   
- Built-in video player using Tkinter

## 🎥 Demo

### 🟢 Safe Zone

> Vehicles in the green zone with safe speed are shown in green boxes. No alert is triggered.

### 🟡🔴 Alert Zones

> Vehicles overlapping yellow or red zones with higher speed trigger caution (yellow) or danger (red) alerts if it exceeds speed limit.

## 📦 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pritam2058/CollisionDetection-AwarenessSystem.git
cd CollisionDetection-AwarenessSystem

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- tkinter
- Pillow (PIL)
- pygame
- ultralytics

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Loads video and applies YOLOv8 to detect vehicles.
2. Filters detections that fall inside the trapezoidal lane zone.
3. DeepSORT tracks vehicles across frames.
4. Speed is estimated using homography mapping (pixel → meter).
5. Zone-based logic applies:
   - Green zone: Speed safe
   - Yellow zone: Speed caution
   - Red zone: Speed danger
6. GUI shows traffic-light indicator and plays alert sounds accordingly.
